## How to Contribute

## Coding Style

We ask that all contributors follow the guidelines below when contributing code to the project:

- Use four spaces for indentation. Do not use tabs.
- Use descriptive, meaningful names for variables and methods.
- Use @Override when overriding a method.
- Use TODO comments to mark places in the code that need attention or further development.
- The maximum width of a line should be 120 characters. If a line of code exceeds this limit, it should be wrapped to
  the next line, with appropriate indentation.

Following these guidelines helps to ensure that the code is consistent, easy to read, and well-documented. Thank you for
following these guidelines when contributing to the project!
